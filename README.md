# SynTact
 🧬 CAR-T Target Discovery with Machine Learning A research-driven machine learning pipeline for identifying optimal antigen targets in ovarian cancer for CAR-T cell therapy. This project focuses on analyzing tumor vs. normal expression data, filtering for cell surface proteins, and scoring candidates based on safety, specificity, and therapeutic potential.  Core Features:  🧠 ML-powered ranking of tumor-specific cell surface proteins  🔬 Integration of TCGA, GTEx, and Human Protein Atlas datasets  📊 Custom scoring for safety and immunogenicity  🧪 Foundation for CAR construct generation (Track B)  🌐 Streamlit-based prototype interface for researchers and labs  Goal: Build an open, accessible tool to accelerate personalized immunotherapy research — starting with ovarian cancer and expanding to other tumor types.
